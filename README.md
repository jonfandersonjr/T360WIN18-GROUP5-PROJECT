# Urban Parks Job Management System
This project was completed at the University of Washington Tacoma as a final project for CSS 360 - Software Quality Assurance Techniques.

The project features three user types - Volunteers, Park Managers, and Office Staff. Each of the users has a unique interface with different options/selections available to them. Additionally, the project was completed in compliance with several business rules and user stories given to the development team to implement. All user stories have been tested with 100% code coverage, following common test naming conventions and techniques.

Structure of the code has been seperated into model and view packages. Code follows proper object oriented design principals such as the Law of Demeter. Front end classes do not contain any business logic, leaving the back end to handle these implementations.
